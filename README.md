## 📈 Scalability & Extensibility

This SaaS Subscription Management Platform is designed with a modular and scalable architecture. The codebase follows a clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend, making it easy to maintain and extend.

- 🧩 **Modular Structure:** Features are divided into independent modules (auth, users, companies, subscriptions), so new features can be added without affecting existing logic.
- 🔌 **API-driven backend:** RESTful APIs ensure smooth communication between frontend and backend, making it easy to integrate new services or microservices later.
- 🏗️ **Component-based frontend:** React components are reusable and scalable, allowing new UI features to be added quickly.
- 🗄️ **Database flexibility:** MongoDB schema design supports easy extension of fields and collections without breaking existing data flow.
- ⚡ **Future-ready:** New features like payments, analytics, notifications, or AI tools can be integrated with minimal changes to core structure.

Overall, the project is built to support long-term growth, easy feature expansion, and clean maintainability.
